====================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`aclhound` [ commands ]

## DESCRIPTION

ACLHound compiles generic firewall policies into platform specific
configuration

ACLHound takes as input a custom policy language and compiles a
representation specific for the specified vendor which can be deployed
on firewall devices.

ACLHound is designed to assist humans in managing hundreds of ACLs
across tens of devices. One key focus point is maximum re-usability of
ACL components such as groups of hosts, groups of ports and the policies
themselves.
