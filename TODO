- add grouping of port ranges in efficient way

- add greater/then lesser/then to the language

- add 'log' (disable not needed, just comment out the policy line)

- 1 input policy will generate two ACLs, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6
    * in config decide what the v4 or v6 suffix/prefix is

- add the concept of a 'hack' (manual non-compiled ACL, useful for migrations)


- add IOS support (should be almost same as ASA)

- add Juniper support (comes after all other features are done)


aclhound build <file> [ vendor ]
    - file can be either a device file or a policy file
    - if policy file:
        - require vendor 
    - print to stdout

aclhound diff <file> [ vendor ]
    - branch to previous commit
    - compile for file (if device just proceed, if policy require vendor)
    - checkout head again
    - compile file
    - produce unified diff

aclhound submit
    - do diff-all
    - [x] git-review

aclhound force-deploy
    - warn that the reviewed version will be pushed, not the local version
    - trigger jenkins job

[x] add /etc/aclhound.conf and ~/.aclhound.conf files parsing

[x] aclhound init
    - check if /etc/aclhound.conf exists, take defaults from there
    - ask where to store aclhound files, suggest ~/aclhound
    
[x] aclhound fetch
    - git pull & rebase

NOTES:

    use http://packetpushers.net/cisco-configuration-archive-rollback-using-revert-instead-of-reload/ on IOS for confirm/rollback

    ASA: 
        - remove ACL from interfaces first
        - Upload ACL
            ( clear access-list ...
              access-list derp derp )
        - add ACL back to interfaces
